                        <h5>2003-05:Rise to the first team</h5>
                        <p>During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with
                        Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's
                        ranks, debuting for a record five teams in a single
                        campaign. After being named player of the tournament in
                        four international pre-season competitions with the
                        Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the
                        team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he
                        scored 18 goals in 11 league games.</p>
                        <h5>2005-08: Making the starting eleven</h5>
                        <p>On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his
                        first contract as a senior team player. It made him a
                        Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his
                        previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to
                        €150 million.the 19-year-old Messi established himself
                        as one of the best players in the world during the
                        2006–07 campaign</p>
                        <h5>The second Maradona</h5>
                        <p>Already frequently compared to compatriot Diego
                        Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly
                        replicated Maradona's two most famous goals in the span
                        of three weeks.[57] During a Copa del Rey semi-final
                        against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably
                        similar to Maradona's goal in the quarter-finals of the
                        1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century.
                        Messi collected the ball on the right side near the
                        halfway line ,ran 60 metres (200 ft), and beat five
                        defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as
                        Maradona had done. A league match against Espanyol on 9
                        June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and
                        guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar
                        fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same
                        World Cup match. As Messi continued his individual
                        rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the
                        Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the
                        second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real
                        Madrid on goal average.</p>

                                    <h4>2011-13: Assuming the captaincy</h4>
                                    <p>After Argentina's unsuccessful
                                    performance in the Copa América, Batista
                                    was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his
                                    appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded
                                    the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the
                                    squad, in accord with then-captain Javier
                                    Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went
                                    on to lead his squad by example as their
                                    best player, while Mascherano continued to
                                    fulfil the role of the team's on-field
                                    leader and motivator. In a further redesign
                                    of the team, Sabella dismissed Tévez and
                                    brought in players with whom Messi had won
                                    the World Youth Championship and Olympic
                                    Games. Now playing in a free role in an
                                    improving team, Messi finally ended his
                                    goal draught by scoring during their first
                                    World Cup qualifying match against Chile on
                                    7 October, his first official goal for
                                    Argentina in two-and-a-half years</p>
                                    <h4>2014-15: World Cup and Copa America
                                    finals</h4>
                                    <p>Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts
                                    persisted over Messi's form, as he finished
                                    an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season
                                    with Barcelona. At the start of the
                                    tournament, however, he gave strong
                                    performances, being elected man of the
                                    match in their first four matches.In his
                                    first World Cup match as captain, he led
                                    them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and
                                    Herzegovina; he helped create their early
                                    opening goal and scored their second strike
                                    after a dribble past three players, his
                                    first World Cup goal since his debut in the
                                    tournament eight years earlier.[255] During
                                    the second match against Iran, he scored an
                                    injury-time goal from 23 metres out to end
                                    the game in a 1–0 win, securing their
                                    qualification for the knockout phase.He
                                    scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2
                                    victory over Nigeria, his second goal from
                                    a free kick, as they finished first in
                                    their group.[257] Messi assisted a late
                                    goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win
                                    against Switzerland in the round of 16 ,
                                    before starting the play that led to their
                                    match-winning 1–0 goal in the quarter-final
                                    against Belgium, helping Argentina progress
                                    to the semi-final of the World Cup for the
                                    first time since 1990. Following a 0–0 draw
                                    in extra time, they eliminated the
                                    Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to
                                    reach the final</p>
